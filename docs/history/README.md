### 2026-05-20 cleanup/v22-full-taxonomy-hard-retirement

Status: `ready_for_b_review`

Branch: `cleanup/v22-full-taxonomy-hard-retirement`

Base trunk HEAD: `365c2a676ed243ead64338d62ce2ec6262ce4767`

Model:

- controller: `gpt-5.4`
- subagent Kant: `gpt-5.4`, read-only recovery/truth audit
- subagent Nietzsche: `gpt-5.4`, read-only smoke/eval audit
- subagent Turing: `gpt-5.4`, read-only scripts/reference audit

Scope:

- Adopt OPL-style docs taxonomy as active truth.
- Absorb distributed contracts into `docs/specs/README.md`.
- Retire legacy recovery/docs/scripts/test fixtures that only carried stage history.
- Keep `scripts/sync-workspace-file-to-minio.ps1` because `services/portal/src/config/portal-config.mjs` still references it and this branch does not modify services.
- Keep current business cursor on `leaf-portal-postgres-redis-local-production-data-closure`; this cleanup does not claim PostgreSQL/Redis implementation.

Contract subscription:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/active/README.md`
- `docs/specs/README.md`
- `docs/policies/README.md`
- `docs/delivery/README.md`
- `docs/source/README.md`
- `tests/fixtures/v22/goal-current.json`
- `tests/fixtures/v22/agent-verify-manifest.json`
- `scripts/v22-verify.mjs`
- `scripts/v22-test-classification.mjs`
- `scripts/v22-workflow-gate.mjs`

Non-goals:

- No PostgreSQL/Redis implementation.
- No services business code change.
- No real cloud, secret read, build/push, kubectl, deploy or live-test.
- No upstream modification.
- No Figma UI visual/layout/information-architecture change.

Commits:

- `7516c29 cleanup(v22): retire eval smoke filename semantics`
- `89b57cd cleanup(v22): absorb contracts into specs truth`
- `78e4a7b cleanup(v22): retire recovery into taxonomy truth`
- `06f4d4e docs(v22): record full taxonomy hard retirement run`
- `5508387 fix(v22): allow authorized taxonomy smoke-name deletions`
- final closeout commit: records this post-fix trace update.

Verification before closeout:

- `node tests/regression/portal/regression-test-v22-portal-runtime-suite.mjs --group all`: pass.
- `node tests/contract/contract-test-v22-mvp-contract-suite.mjs`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs current --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite health --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite smoke --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite local-contract --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite local-regression --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`: pass.
- `node scripts/v22-workflow-gate.mjs review --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk`: pass.
- `git diff --check -- AGENTS.md README.md DESIGN.md docs tests scripts`: pass.
- Added-lines secret value scan over `origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk...HEAD` and `AGENTS.md README.md DESIGN.md docs tests scripts`: pass, no matches.
- Local-regression note: this isolated worktree has no installed `services/portal/frontend/node_modules/typescript`; final local-regression was re-run with temporary ignored symlinks to the main worktree's existing `services/portal/node_modules` and `services/portal/frontend/node_modules`, then those symlinks were removed before handoff.
- Retired-path scan for old recovery/contracts/root-doc/helper-script literals: only the hard-retirement self-test retains constructed legacy literals as a regression guard.

B review packet:

- Review branch: `cleanup/v22-full-taxonomy-hard-retirement`.
- Review base: `365c2a676ed243ead64338d62ce2ec6262ce4767`.
- Review focus: docs taxonomy hard retirement, `docs/specs/README.md` as single spec truth, `docs/active/README.md` as single current truth, `tests/fixtures/v22/*` as machine truth, and `scripts/` reduced to runner/classifier/workflow plus the service-referenced PowerShell helper.
- Verify: run `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs current --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`, `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite local-contract --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`, `node scripts/v22-verify.mjs suite local-regression --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk --json`, `node scripts/v22-workflow-gate.mjs review --base origin/recovery/platform-v22-trunk`, and `git diff --check -- AGENTS.md README.md DESIGN.md docs tests scripts`.
- Absorb rule: only B may fresh review, ff-only merge to `recovery/platform-v22-trunk`, push, and run post-push verification.

Risk notes:

- Large deletion diff is intentional. B should check that removed contract leaves are absorbed into `docs/specs/README.md`, removed recovery stage records are summarized here, and removed tests are no longer active manifest entries.
- `scripts/sync-workspace-file-to-minio.ps1` remains because services still reference it; removing it requires a service-surface branch.
- `local-regression` now runs `tests/regression/portal/regression-test-v22-portal-runtime-suite.mjs --group all`; that suite excludes build and true cloud operations.
- No B review or absorb has happened in this A window.

Next recommendation:

- After B absorb and post-push truth confirmation, resume the current product cursor: `leaf-portal-postgres-redis-local-production-data-closure`.

## Reading Rule

Use history to understand how a change was made. Use active/specs/policies/delivery/source and verify fixtures to decide what is currently true.
